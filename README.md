# Alarm-ios8-swift

Upgraded to ios9 and swift 2.1!
This project aims to create a clone of the apple's official clock alarm application for study purpose and will come with a series of tutorial (not written yet though).    
Now the clone looks pretty much like the official one and could work properly, have a try!

##Todo List
* Appearance adjustment
* Class re-design
